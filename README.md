## Overview

Future Droidux is an immersive web experience exploring the intersection of motion, intelligence, and adaptive interface design. It opens with an 18-second cinematic intro — a dark cosmos of drifting particles and a self-drawing orbital logo — before transitioning into the warm-white main experience.

### Experience Flow

```
[ Dark Cinematic Intro — 18s ]
        ↓  fade to warm white
[ Warm White Main Interface ]
```

### Intro Design Highlights

- **Particle constellation field** — 140 drifting gold particles with dynamic connections
- **Self-drawing orbital logo** — concentric rings and ellipses animate in via SVG stroke-dashoffset
- **Text reveal sequence** — brand name sweeps in, tagline and subtitle fade up
- **Corner frame markers** — subtle UI framing elements
- **Bottom progress bar** — 18-second linear progress indicator
- **Skip button** — available after 4 seconds for returning users

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vignesh2027/Future-Droidux.git
cd Future-Droidux
python3 -m http.server 3000
# open http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** The experience requires a local server (not `file://`) because the bundle uses blob URLs.

## Design Philosophy

> *Motion is not decoration — it is meaning.*

Future Droidux treats every transition as communication. The intro sequence is calibrated to prime the viewer's attention before the main interface reveals itself — dark to light, cosmos to clarity, complexity to calm.
